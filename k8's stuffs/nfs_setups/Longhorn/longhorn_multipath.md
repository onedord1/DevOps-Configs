# 🚀 Longhorn CSI Mount Issue Fix  

## ❗ Issue  

Pods using Longhorn volumes may fail to start due to errors in `longhorn-csi-plugin`, specifically related to **mount failures** caused by `multipathd`.  

### 🔍 Error Message  
```log
Mounting command: mount
Mounting arguments: -t ext4 -o defaults /dev/longhorn/pvc-xxxx /var/lib/kubelet/pods/xxx/mount
Output: mount: /var/lib/kubelet/pods/xxx/mount: /dev/longhorn/pvc-xxxx already mounted or mount point busy.
```

---

## 🎯 Root Cause  

The **multipath daemon (`multipathd`)** automatically creates multipath devices for block devices, including Longhorn volumes. This results in **conflicts when mounting Longhorn volumes**, preventing pods from starting.

---

## ✅ Solution  

### 1️⃣ Check Longhorn Devices  

Run the following command to **list devices created by Longhorn**:  
```bash
lsblk
```
🔹 Longhorn devices typically have names like `/dev/sd[x]`.

---

### 2️⃣ Modify `multipath.conf`  

1. **Create the configuration file** (if it doesn’t exist):  
   ```bash
   sudo touch /etc/multipath.conf
   ```

2. **Add the following blacklist rule**:  
   ```conf
   blacklist {
       devnode "^sd[a-z0-9]+"
   }
   ```

---

### 3️⃣ Restart Multipath Service  

Apply the changes by restarting the multipath daemon:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart multipathd.service
```

---

### 4️⃣ Verify Configuration  

Check if the new configuration is applied:  
```bash
multipath -t
```

🎉 **Your pods should now be able to mount Longhorn volumes correctly!**

---

## 📌 Additional Tips  

- Ensure that `longhorn-csi-plugin` logs are clear of mount errors.
- If the issue persists, consider rebooting the node after applying the fix.
- Check the status of multipath with:  
  ```bash
  systemctl status multipathd.service
  ```
