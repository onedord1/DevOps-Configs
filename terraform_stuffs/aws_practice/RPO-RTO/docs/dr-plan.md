# ShopSmart Disaster Recovery Plan Theory

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures for responding to a disaster event affecting the ShopSmart application.

## Disaster Classification
1. **Minor Incident**: Single component failure (e.g., single EC2 instance)
2. **Partial Outage**: Multiple component failures in primary region (e.g., AZ failure)
3. **Major Disaster**: Complete failure of primary region

## Response Procedures

### Minor Incident
1. Identify the failed component using CloudWatch alarms
2. Replace or restart the failed component
3. Monitor for resolution
4. Document the incident

### Partial Outage
1. Assess the impact on application functionality
2. If critical functionality is affected, consider initiating failover
3. Follow the Major Disaster procedure if failover is initiated

### Major Disaster
1. **Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)**
   - Verify the failure using multiple monitoring sources
   - Initiate automated failover using the API Gateway endpoint
   - Notify stakeholders of the failover

2. **Verification (5-15 minutes)**
   - Verify that the secondary region is serving traffic
   - Verify that the database has been promoted to writer
   - Verify that the application is functioning correctly

3. **Recovery (15-60 minutes)**
   - Monitor the application in the secondary region
   - Address any issues that arise during the failover
   - Keep stakeholders informed of the recovery progress

4. **Restoration (1-24 hours)**
   - Once the primary region is restored, initiate failback
   - Verify that the primary region is functioning correctly
   - Document the incident and response

## Testing Procedures
1. Schedule regular DR tests (at least quarterly)
2. Use the DR test script to simulate a failover/failback
3. Measure actual RPO and RTO during tests
4. Update the DR plan based on test results
