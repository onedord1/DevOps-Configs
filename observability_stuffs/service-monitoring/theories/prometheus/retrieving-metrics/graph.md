## Graph Visualization

We can get the graph visualization of our metrics by using the `Graph` tab in the Prometheus web UI. The graph visualization helps us to understand the patterns of our metrics over time whether it is increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant.

**Note**: The graph visualization is only available for the `Instant Vector` data type not for the `Range Vector` data type.
