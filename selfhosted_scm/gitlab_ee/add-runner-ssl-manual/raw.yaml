There might be a problem with your config based on jsonschema annotations in common/config.go (experimental feature):
jsonschema: '/runners/0/custom_build_dir/enabled' does not validate with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/common/config#/$ref/properties/runners/items/$ref/properties/custom_build_dir/$ref/properties/enabled/type: expected boolean, but got null
 
Enter the GitLab instance URL (for example, https://gitlab.com/):

WARNING: Support for registration tokens and runner parameters in the 'register' command has been deprecated in GitLab Runner 15.6 and will be replaced with support for authentication tokens. For more information, see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow 
Registering runner... succeeded                     runner=QZNrYLx5
