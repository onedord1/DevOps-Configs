## Prometheus and Grafana Introduction

### Why we have to use Grafana with Prometheus?

`Prometheus` is good for collecting and storing Metrics. But the visualization of data is not good in prometheus. So we can use `Grafana` to visualize the data. Grafana is a open source visualization tool. We can create the dashboards in Grafana to visualize the data. In Grafana dashbards we can create the graphs, charts, tables etc. we can connect Grafana with many data sources like Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, ElasticSearch etc. So our graphs and charts will get data from Prometheus(Data sources) and we can visualize the data in Grafana. We can also create alerts in Grafana and it will give us also visual understanding of alerts.
