## Annotations in Grafana

We can use `annotations` to mark data points or range of data points for specific events on the graph.

### Steps to add annotations in Grafana

1. We can add annotations on graph by click on time range pressing `ctrl` key and then Click on the point on graph to add annotation. Now we can add `Description` and `Tags` for the annotation.
2. We can select range of data points on graph by using `Ctrl` key and by dragging the mouse to select the range.


### Disable Annotations

1. Go to `Settings of dashboard` -> Click on `Annotations` -> Click on `--Grafa--` -> Uncheck the `Enable` checkbox.
